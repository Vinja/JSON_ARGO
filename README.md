JSON File Converter

I created this JSON file as part of my Batman Database 101 training, 
which include a section on grabbing and converting JSON files to .csv format

[7/16/2012] 
- Added Mark Bakers PHP Excel to JSON converter to play around with some 
JSON files I have sitting around. The original files can be found at https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel.
